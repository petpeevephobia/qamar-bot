# Qamar

A personal Telegram bot that captures ideas when you're away from your laptop — voice notes in, organised notes out.

## Why

I think better out loud, especially when ideas hit and I don't have Obsidian handy. Qamar lets me send a quick voice message from my phone and turns it into a structured note in my vault, so nothing gets lost between walks, commutes, and late-night brain dumps.

## What it does

Qamar receives voice messages on Telegram, transcribes them, and turns spoken ideas into structured markdown notes in your Obsidian vault (via Google Drive). Tags stay in sync so the LLM can reuse your existing vocabulary when drafting new notes.

**Stack:** Python, Telegram, Groq (transcription), Gemini (notes), Google Drive OAuth (vault sync).

## Features

### Voice → note

- Send a **voice message**; Qamar transcribes it with **Groq Whisper** (`whisper-large-v3`).
- Say **"new idea"** in the recording to trigger note creation. Without that phrase, the bot replies `No new idea.` and does not write a file.
- **Gemini** (`gemini-2.5-flash`) drafts the note from `brain/template.md` (title, tags, maturity, references) and your system prompt in `brain/qamar_role.txt`.
- New notes are uploaded to your configured **Google Drive folder** (`GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`), which syncs to Obsidian. The filename is derived from the note’s `# Title` heading.
- Timestamps in prompts use **`QAMAR_TIMEZONE`** (default `Europe/Berlin`).

### Tags

- Known tags live in **`brain/tags.txt`**. When creating a note, Gemini is told to prefer existing tags and only add new `[[tag]]` entries when needed (lowercase, up to 5).
- After a successful save, any **new tags** from the note are appended to `tags.txt`.

### Telegram commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|----------------|
| `/start` | Intro and quick help |
| `/reauth` | Link to reconnect Google Drive when OAuth expires |
| `/delete` | Find the **most recent** `.md` in your vault folder, show its **name** and **created** date/time, and ask for confirmation via inline buttons |

### Delete flow

- **Yes, delete** — removes the file from Drive, then scans other vault notes; any tag that existed **only** on the deleted note is removed from `tags.txt`.
- **Cancel** — aborts without deleting.
- Debug logs record when a delete is requested, confirmed, or rejected.

### Groq / Gemini rate limits

- If **Groq** or **Gemini** hits a daily rate limit, the bot replies with the usual message plus **how long until midnight Pacific** when limits reset (e.g. `Resets in 9h 42m (midnight Pacific).`).
- If you were limited that Pacific calendar day, Qamar sends a **midnight Pacific** DM when the day rolls over: limits have reset and you can send voice notes again.
- Flags are stored in `brain/rate_limit_notify.json` (same persistence caveats as `tags.txt` on Fly).

### Google Drive auth

- A small **OAuth web app** (FastAPI on port `8080`) handles Drive login and token refresh. If auth fails during upload or delete, Qamar replies with a reconnect URL (same flow as `/reauth`).

### Google Drive setup (Web OAuth)

1. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/): enable **Google Drive API**.
2. **Credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application**.
3. **Authorized redirect URIs** (must match exactly):
   - Local: `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`
   - Fly: `https://qamar-bot.fly.dev/oauth/callback`
4. Download JSON as `credentials.json` in the project root.
5. In `.env`: set `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`, `OAUTH_LINK_SECRET` (random string), `BASE_URL`, `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`.
6. Run `python main.py`, then open the URL from `python -m modules.authorize_drive` (or send `/reauth` in Telegram).

When Drive auth expires, the bot replies with a reconnect link or use `/reauth`.

**Fly secrets:** set `BASE_URL`, `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`, `OAUTH_LINK_SECRET`, and after first auth set the Drive token from file (avoids broken escaping):

```bash
fly secrets set GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN_JSON=@token.json -a qamar-bot
```

Use a single `{` at the start of the JSON — `{{...}}` will break parsing. Re-run `/reauth` on Fly if uploads still fail after updating the secret.

## On the horizon

- RAG over existing Obsidian notes to help ideate on new projects (problem statements, SWOT, stack-aware suggestions for Python, TypeScript, Go, SQL)
- Sync exisiting tags in Obsidian to  tags in `tags.txt` so Qamar is always aware of tags that may be manually added or deleted
